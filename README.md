# Usability Evaluation of a Hospital Management System through the System Usability Scale (SUS): A Study with Patients and Physicians
## ABSTRACT
This study presents a quantitative usability evaluation of the hospital management system SANDRA 2.0 using the System Usability
Scale (SUS). A total of 560 users participated, including 539 patients and 21 physicians. SUS questionnaires were administered immedi-
ately after real interactions with two key modules of the system: appointment scheduling (patients) and the electronic health record
(physicians). Results indicate overall high usability, with mean SUS scores of 75.1 for patients and 77.1 for physicians. The study rein-
forces the applicability of SUS in hospital settings and contributes to the continuous improvement of healthcare systems based on
empirical evidence.
